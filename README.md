So, I ran into many issues throughout this little project:
first I could not loop through a object as I expected, having to scrap the JS file about 4-5 times before I semi-hardcoded everything.
second the check boxes I added would not output a class or data- that I added via .attr, just checked and unchecked.
third I couldnt figure out the timer, I did an hour's worth of research. Either I didn't understand or I could be brain dead.

Pseudo coding:
Final page needed a final score of Right answers, Wrong answers, and Unanswered questions (right and wrong were in the JS file),
also needing a 'reset' button which i would have set to clear the .final div then spilled out the original contents. As for counting the
amount of right, wrong, and unanswered, I wanted to set each input against a if statment that collected the data- from the check boxes. Adding to the 'right' variable or 'wrong' variable etc. For the 'reset' I would have just used a .empty() since I have the divs set up in three sections. I am currently learing how to apply timers to HTML.

To Whomever reads this. I would like to come in during office hours and be ran through this, where I went wrong. Also, need a tutor, my fault, I am getting on that now.
